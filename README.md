Welcome to the Wikipedia Web Graph project! This project aims to explore the relationships between Wikipedia articles using graph theory. By analyzing the connections between articles, we can gain insights into how topics are related and navigate the vast network of information present on Wikipedia.

## Understanding the Degree of Relation:
In graph theory, the degree of a node represents the number of edges connected to that node. In the context of the Wikipedia Web Graph, each Wikipedia article is a node, and the links between articles are the edges. Therefore, the degree of relation between two articles can be understood by examining the number of links that directly connect them.
