Welcome to the Wikipedia Graph Web project! This project is all about exploring the relationships between Wikipedia articles using graph theory. By looking at how different articles are connected, we can gain a better understanding of how topics are related and navigate the vast network of information on Wikipedia.

## Understanding the Degree of Relation:
Just to give you a quick overview, in graph theory the degree of a node is basically the number of edges connected to that node.
When it comes to Wikipedia, each article is a node, with the links between them acting as the edges. This helps us get a sense of how connected two articles are by looking at the number of links between them.


Basically Im trying to find out the minimum degree of relation between 2 items on wikipedia.
